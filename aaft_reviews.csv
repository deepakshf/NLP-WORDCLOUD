"I completed a diploma program at AAFT, and while a few faculty members were commendable, I would advise against enrolling there to avoid wasting your money. The placement department proved to be entirely unhelpful they initially offered just 8k salary and an unpaid stipend for the internship, putting undue pressure on students. Reflecting on this, I question whether investing in this program was worthwhile given the limited compensation and unpaid internship offered."
"As a student of AAFT, I can say that it is an excellent college that provides great exposure in the field of film and Television. For example the college have a radio station that provides exposure to radio for the students and they even have a newsletter committee which is handled by students.The professors are highly experienced and knowledgeable and they make it easy for students to understand the concept. The college also organises seminars and workshops with industry experts which is a great opportunity for students to learn and grow.I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to pursue a career in this industry."
"It's been an year now that i joined this university and i am really glad that i chose this place, not just because of its great faculty and strong curriculum but also due to its phenomenal practical approach and hands on learning experience. I visited multiple media giants, experienced the world behind camera and interacted with media veterans face-to-face. I am really excited for more upcoming opportunities and experiences here!"
"Fraud institute, took my money in advance for all security deposits and next semester advance money, but when I decided to take a drop , my money stayed with them for the batch to finally graduate, and then they will refund everyone's money including mine. And for this I was hassled thrice. Thank You AAFT for showing money seeking interest , with students who have financial issues. Never recommend this college to anyone, they don't even have their own degree. What else can you expect?"

"It's been an year now that i joined this university and i am really glad that i chose this place, not just because of its great faculty and strong curriculum but also due to its phenomenal practical approach and hands on learning experience. I visited multiple media giants, experienced the world behind camera and interacted with media veterans face-to-face. I am really excited for more upcoming opportunities and experiences here!"
"Fraud institute, took my money in advance for all security deposits and next semester advance money, but when I decided to take a drop , my money stayed with them for the batch to finally graduate, and then they will refund everyone's money including mine. And for this I was hassled thrice. Thank You AAFT for showing money seeking interest , with students who have financial issues. Never recommend this college to anyone, they don't even have their own degree. What else can you expect?"

"I enrolled at the Asian Academy of films and television with high hopes and aspirations and I can confidently say that my experience as a student has exceeded all my expectation. AAFT has truly been and transformative journey providing me with an exceptional education and practical experience. AAFT have an incredibly talented and experience faculty which help students to actively participate and learn. The Academy dedication to excellence knowledgeable instructors, cutting edge facilities and thorough curriculum have given me the knowledge and self assurance I need to achieve my goals in the industry the best is the best place to go if you are seeking for media education that will change your life"
"So far it has been an absolutely amazing and enthralling experience for me to study and polish my skills at AAFT. I belong to the School of Journalism and Mass Communication which has made me learn innumerable new skills through the means of different tasks and assignments. I never thought that I can write or edit so well, but after all the tasks that I as a student was assigned to, I got to know the true potential. The level of practical exposure that I've gotten from this college is incomparable to any other college. I'd suggest anybody looking to upgrade themselves and their live's productivity to take admission in this college because it has a lot to offer to its students be it writing, editing, photography, fashion or be it any other field, it has it all. This college has been very amazing."
This place is pretty amazing with great exposure and exciting opportunities ranging from working in In-House newspapers to actually shooting a commercial. The faculty is very experienced and masters of their own field.The best part of AAFT is that it provides all facilities from equipment to venue which ensures maximum productivity and creative freedom.
"If you are confused about Aaft which is located in Film City, Noida so, let me tell you about this college or institute this institute is excellent.  The faculty is adorable and helpful nature. The behaviour and everything is good.  They provide a lot of practical training which ultimately helps us to develop the necessary skills and groom our personalities.The infrastructure and facilities were also fabulous.  It is the best platform for the media and arts industry. This industry provides relevant equipment.  We all know today's time theory and practicals are much important in current life so, here professors train you both in this industry which is to extend your professionalism.They give tips about how to start a career on different platforms,  face challenges and competition, make the best use of the opportunities, how to make a presence in the market and so much more. All these experiences have helped me a lot. The faculty try to solve all your problems ."
"The experience is surreal. The infrastructure and the college is great. The faculty is very supportive to each and every student. The practical exposure provided by the college gives us an insight of the activity. The global festivals are celebrated every year in the college where the students can get the industry type experience and know the on ground difficulties and problems they can face. The events organized by the college are also funn and interactive, as most of them are organised by students which help them in personality development. There are many useful workshops from the experienced people out in the industry."
"I completed a diploma program at AAFT, and while a few faculty members were commendable, I would advise against enrolling there to avoid wasting your money. The placement department proved to be entirely unhelpful they initially offered just 8k salary and an unpaid stipend for the internship, putting undue pressure on students. Reflecting on this, I question whether investing in this program was worthwhile given the limited compensation and unpaid internship offered."
